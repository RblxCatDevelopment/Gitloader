# Readme
All the files inside ./roblox/game will be put into the game, while everything inside of ./roblox/plugin will be put into the plugin.
This system was designed for cat's use only!

# What is this?
This is a repo system designed for cat, to let cat members easily sync a repository with their games, without having to do any work
other than link it with the plugin!

# Usage
## Creating directories
When creating a new folder, you have to type the object name first, for example "Model" or "Folder" then type ".", and then finally type the name of the object
This will allow you to create specific types of objects to store scripts in
### Example names:
#### Model.Example name 1
#### Model.Example.name.2
#### Folder.Example name 3
#### Part.Example name 4
#### ScreenGui.Example Name 5

Essentially they are the object names, so you can easily specify what one to use!

## Creating scripts
When creating scripts, you have to essentially declare them the same way as the folders, but layed out a bit differently
First type the name, then type ".", then type "localscript", "modulescript", or "script", then type ".lua"
### Examples
#### script 1.modulescript.lua
#### script 2.script.lua
#### script.3.localscript.lua
